# Java Lab Questions <br>
[1. To find the sum of any number of integers entered as command line arguments.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q1.java)<br>
[2. To find the factorial of a given number.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q2.java)<br> 
[3. To convert a decimal to binary number.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q3.java)<br>
[4. To check if a number is prime or not, by taking the number as input from the keyboard.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q4.java)<br>
[5. To find the sum of any number of integers interactively, i.e., entering every number from the
keyboard, whereas the total number of integers is given as a command line argument](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q5.java)<br>
[6. Write a program that show working of different functions of String and StringBufferclasss
like setCharAt( ), setLength( ), append( ), insert( ), concat( )and equals( ).](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q6.java)<br> 
[7. Write a program to create a – “distance” class with methods where distance is computed in
terms of feet and inches, how to create objects of a class and to see the use of this pointer](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q7.java)<br> 
[8. Modify the – “distance” class by creating constructor for assigning values (feetandinches) to
the distance object. Create another object and assign second object as reference variable to
another object reference variable. Further create a third object which is a clone of the first
object.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q8.java)<br> 
[9. Write a program to show that during function overloading, if no matching argument is
found, then Java will apply automatic type conversions (from lower to higher data type)](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q9.java)<br> 
[10. Write a program to show the difference between public and private access specifiers. The
program should also show that primitive data types are passed by value and objects are
passed by reference and to learn use of final keyword.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q10.java)<br> 
[11. Write a program to show the use of static functions and to pass variable length arguments
in a function.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q11.java)<br> 
[14. Write a program to demonstrate the concept of boxing and unboxing.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q14.java)<br>
[15. Create a multi-file program where in one file a string message is taken as input from the user
and the function to display the message on the screen is given in another file (make use of
Scanner package in this program).](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q15.java)<br>
[16. Write a program to create a multilevel package and also creates a reusable class to
generate Fibonacci series, where the function to generate Fibonacci series is given in a
different file belonging to the same package.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q16)<br> 
[17. Write a program that creates illustrates different levels of protection in
classes/subclasses belonging to same package or different packages](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q17)<br> 
[18. Write a program – “DivideByZero” that takes two numbers a and b as input, computes a/b,
and invokes Arithmetic Exception to generate a message when the denominator is zero.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q18.java)<br> 
[19. Write a program to show the use of nested try statements that emphasizes the sequence of
checking for catch handler statements. ](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q19.java)<br>
[20. Write a program to create your own exception types to handle situation specific to your
application (Hint: Define a subclass of Exception which itself is a subclass of Throwable).](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q20.java)<br>
[21. Write a program to demonstrate priorities among multiple threads.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q21.java)<br>
[22. Write a program to demonstrate different mouse handling events like mouseClicked( ),
mouseEntered( ), mouseExited( ), mousePressed( ), mouseReleased( ) & mouseDragged( ).](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q22.java)<br>
[23. Write a program to demonstrate different keyboard handling events.](https://github.com/adityapapu/Java/blob/main/lab_questions/q23.java)<br>
